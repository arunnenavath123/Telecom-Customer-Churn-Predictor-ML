# Telecom Customer Churn Predictor with LLM Explanation

This project is an interactive web application that predicts whether a telecom customer will churn and provides a plain-language explanation for the prediction using a Large Language Model (LLM).

---

## 📌 Overview

The application takes customer information as input, uses a trained XGBoost model to predict churn, and then uses an LLM (via OpenRouter API) to explain the prediction in simple terms.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Predict customer churn using a machine learning model (XGBoost)
* Collect user input through a friendly Streamlit interface
* Provide human-readable explanations using DeepSeek LLM (Qwen3-8B)
* Visualize processed input data and prediction confidence
* Secure API key handling via `.env` file

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* Streamlit
* pandas & NumPy
* scikit-learn
* XGBoost
* OpenRouter API (LLM: DeepSeek Qwen3-8B)
* joblib

---

## 🧠 Model Details

The XGBoost model is trained on telecom customer data with features such as:

* Demographics (Gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents)
* Account details (Tenure, Contract, PaperlessBilling, PaymentMethod)
* Services (PhoneService, InternetService, StreamingTV, etc.)
* Charges (MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges)

---

## 💡 Explanation Engine

The app generates a detailed, easy-to-understand explanation using the DeepSeek LLM hosted on OpenRouter. It interprets key factors like tenure, contract type, service bundles, and payment method to justify the prediction.
